      <description>January 2022 - Present
 Working on an intensive course project for the class ME597 - Autonomous Systems, which involves, building a 4-wheeled autonomous robot (as shown in the picture above), consisting of Ultrasonic Sensors, a Camera, and a Line Tracking Sensor Processing and handling of all sensor data will be done using a Raspberry Pi on the robot, running Ubuntu 20.04, using ROS and Python  Phase 1 - Robot Kinematics and Control  In this phase, I had to leverage the Line Tracking sensor and the Ultrasonic sensor on board the Autonomous Robot to implement a Line Tracking Module as well as a PID controller The PID controller used the distance in front of the robot to calculate the error from the setpoint, and calculated the output velocity to be sent to the DC motors by using carefully tuned proportional, integral and derivative gains to minimize overshoot and Steady State Error I also learned more about how to calculate forward and inverse kinematics for mobile robots with different wheel configurations, eg: Mecanum wheeled Robot  Phase 2 - Robot Perception  This phase involved the simulation of a Turtlebot to track and chase a red ball in the Gazebo environment.</description>
