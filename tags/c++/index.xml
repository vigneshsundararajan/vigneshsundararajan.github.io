      <description>Image Credits : NASA The growth of UAM and the role of autonomy in it The world as a collective is transitioning to a more autonomous future with the advent of intelligent transportation vehicles running on renewable energy. The technological advancements run in parallel with the rapid increase in urban population density and the need for quick and reliable point-to-point travel. The UAM concept highlights the use of Urban Air Taxis, that can take off and land vertically from densely populated areas, and as such need to be highly reliable as the UAM market is projected to grow to roughly 28.</description>

My earlier configs relied on Vimscript and plugins written in Vimscript, but I felt like I wasn&amp;rsquo;t being minimal enough with my config and not embracing the design philosophy of Neovim.</description>
