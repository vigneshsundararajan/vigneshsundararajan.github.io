      <description>April 2022
 Utilized raw camera data from a Turtlebot in Gazebo using ROS for performing Image Masking using OpenCV Calculated the centroid of object using Moments and then tracked the position of object in the robot&amp;rsquo;s Field of View Implemented a proportional velocity controller to follow the object  You can find the code repository for this project on my GitHub</description>

      <description>August 2021 - December 2021
 Implemented a deep neural network with 16 Residual Blocks, in a Generator-Discriminator pair to upsample low resolution images by a factor of 4, using TensorFlow 2 Trained the model for 50,000 steps on an NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU to analyze the Discriminator and Perceptual Loss trends over time Worked with ~10GB datasets, and used test/train splits for training the GAN Went through 3 peer reviews throughout the course of the semester, and gave a presentation for my Artificial Intelligence course project.</description>

      <description>August 2021 - Present
 As a member of the Aerodynamics subteam, I have worked on carrying out mesh sensitivity analyses for the multi element rear wing using ANSYS FLUENT, in order to strike a balance between mesh element size and computational resources required to run the simulation. This involved parametrizing the mesh element size and trying out a range of sizes for a constant wind speed. Tracked Lift Force, Drag Force, $C_L$ and $ C_D$ Designed Wind Tunnel correlation CFD simulations for correspondence between simulation data and acquired data.</description>
