      <description>January 2022 - Present
 Working on an intensive course project for the class ME597 - Autonomous Systems, which involves, building a 4-wheeled autonomous robot (as shown in the picture above), consisting of Ultrasonic Sensors, a Camera, and a Line Tracking Sensor Processing and handling of all sensor data will be done using a Raspberry Pi on the robot, running Ubuntu 20.04, using ROS and Python  Phase 1 - Robot Kinematics and Control  In this phase, I had to leverage the Line Tracking sensor and the Ultrasonic sensor on board the Autonomous Robot to implement a Line Tracking Module as well as a PID controller The PID controller used the distance in front of the robot to calculate the error from the setpoint, and calculated the output velocity to be sent to the DC motors by using carefully tuned proportional, integral and derivative gains to minimize overshoot and Steady State Error I also learned more about how to calculate forward and inverse kinematics for mobile robots with different wheel configurations, eg: Mecanum wheeled Robot  Phase 2 - Robot Perception  This phase involved the simulation of a Turtlebot to track and chase a red ball in the Gazebo environment.</description>

      <description>August 2021 - December 2021
 Implemented a deep neural network with 16 Residual Blocks, in a Generator-Discriminator pair to upsample low resolution images by a factor of 4, using TensorFlow 2 Trained the model for 50,000 steps on an NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU to analyze the Discriminator and Perceptual Loss trends over time Worked with ~10GB datasets, and used test/train splits for training the GAN Went through 3 peer reviews throughout the course of the semester, and gave a presentation for my Artificial Intelligence course project.</description>

      <description>Nice to meet you. This is me.    &amp;ldquo;Taking on a challenge is a lot like riding a horse. If you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable while you&amp;rsquo;re doing it, you&amp;rsquo;re probably doing it wrong&amp;rdquo;
  - Ted Lasso I strive on learning new things everyday. Whether it be obscure productivity tips, or practicing new languages to see the sparkle in people&amp;rsquo;s eyes when you talk to them in their tongue. My curiosity, coupled with a strong desire to put out nothing but the best is my greatest asset.</description>

      <description>August 2021 - Present
 As a member of the Aerodynamics subteam, I have worked on carrying out mesh sensitivity analyses for the multi element rear wing using ANSYS FLUENT, in order to strike a balance between mesh element size and computational resources required to run the simulation. This involved parametrizing the mesh element size and trying out a range of sizes for a constant wind speed. Tracked Lift Force, Drag Force, $C_L$ and $ C_D$ Designed Wind Tunnel correlation CFD simulations for correspondence between simulation data and acquired data.</description>
