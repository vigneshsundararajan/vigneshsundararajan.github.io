      <description>Starting from scratch Helping set up any organization from scratch is always hard. Defining the culture and accurately capturing the true essence of why we gather is everything. I have always loved minimal design and clutter free visualizations. One of my favourite videos that capture this process is from Apple, which I made sure to share during the very first Keynote of the organization. Here are some of the slides (and the intro!</description>

      <description>An unexpected beginning&amp;hellip; I joined this project with the expectation of being a student and wanting to learn more about Data Science. However, one of the two team leads had to drop out with a spot opening up. I wanted to challenge myself by being not only accountable for my own learning, but also the team member&amp;rsquo;s collective growth. Looking back, it&amp;rsquo;s safe to say it was one of the best decisions I made, even though I was wildly unprepared to take on this challenge.</description>

      <description>Image Credits : NASA The need for secure and autonomous Urban Air Mobility The world as a collective is transitioning to a more autonomous future with the advent of intelligent transportation vehicles running on renewable energy. The UAM concept highlights the use of Urban Air Taxis, that can take off and land vertically from densely populated areas, and as such need to be highly reliable as the UAM market is projected to grow to roughly 28.</description>

      <title>My Neovim config in Lua</title>

      <description>Vimscript is great but Lua makes more sense I have been using Neovim for a little over two years now and it is honestly incredible to see how the software as well as the community has grown into this really inclusive group with a strong focus on collaboration and rapid update cycles.
My earlier configs relied on Vimscript and plugins written in Vimscript, but I felt like I wasn&amp;rsquo;t being minimal enough with my config and not embracing the design philosophy of Neovim.</description>

      <description>This project was my first introduction to Perception and learning about the different image processing techniques that I could apply for Object Detection using the minimal computational resources! I explored methods such as Canny Edge Detection, and Image Masking to extract only the object of interest from the RGB camera feed. Once that is done, I calculated the distance to the object by finding it&amp;rsquo;s centroid and position relative to the robot.</description>

      <title>Path Planning using Graph Search Algorithms</title>

      <description>The GMapping SLAM module on ROS was used to generate an environment map, which was then converted to a graph data structure. This was done by reading in the .pgm and .yaml files into Python, and then inflating the map with a rectangular kernel, followed by conversion to a graph. T he path planning problem was then solved from the map graph representation
Breadth First Search The breadth first search goes through the nodes in an unweighted graph and keeps a queue of the visited and unvisited nodes.</description>

      <title>Monocular Vision based Navigation of a 4-wheeled Robot</title>

      <description>The vision system consisted of a monocular camera system (5MP 1080p Raspberry Pi Camera module) interfaced with a Raspberry Pi running ROS Noetic on Ubuntu. The DC motors running the wheels and the servo controlling the orientation of the camera were handled by an L293D driver board which was connected to the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi First, the camera was calibrated using the camera_calibration ROS package that uses a checkerboard pattern as a target and performs calibration on either a monocular or stereo system.</description>

      <title>Lane Detection using OpenCV</title>

      <description>Lane detection is an important computer vision problem in the context of autonomous driving. In this project, an image is taken as an input and then a Gaussian Blur filter is applied to it. A Sobel Filter was implemented to obtain the grayscale gradient image followed by Canny Edge detection using Non-Max Suppression and Hysteresis Thresholding to extract edges between a specified threshold. Image masking is then used to extract only the edges that are of interest (eg: we don&amp;rsquo;t need the horizon).</description>

      <title>Image Super Resolution using a GAN with a Perceptual Loss Function</title>

      <description>This was my first ever introduction to Deep Learning and AI in general! I chose to work on this project to get myself acquainted with how SOTA networks can be used on a useful problem statement. I came across Ledig, et al. 2017 and was fascinated by how this could be used in numerous applications, say for potentially upsampling low resolution MRI scans instead of purchasing higher cost equipment. The model network proposed was a version of ResNet with 16 Residual Blocks, utilising skip connections, with high level feature maps being captured by a Perceptual Loss Function trained on the VGG network.</description>

      <description>Dataset used MNIST: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
Data augmentation was performed on this dataset by adding a Gaussian noise with $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 0.5$. Test-train splits were then created by concatenating the clean images along with their noisy counterparts.
Model Architecture and Training The autoencoder model designed for this task has two convolutional layers along with max pooling in the encoder, and two transpose convolutional layers in the decoder. Training was done for 10 epochs to reduce the loss to a sufficient level.</description>

      <description>Through this project, I was attempting to understand the K-nearest-neighbors classification algorithm and the process of selecting the optimal estimators.
Understanding the dataset The dataset was a CSV file consisting of PCA values for certain transaction information to protect consumer privacy. The Amount feature is the amount of money in that particular transaction and the Class feature contains two classes safe and fraud
Objective The goal was to find the optimal parameters of the KNN estimator using cross validation and then provide a final estimate of the model&amp;rsquo;s generalization performance via the test set.</description>

      <description>August 2021 - Present
As a member of the Aerodynamics subteam, I have worked on carrying out mesh sensitivity analyses for the multi element rear wing using ANSYS FLUENT, in order to strike a balance between mesh element size and computational resources required to run the simulation. This involved parametrizing the mesh element size and trying out a range of sizes for a constant wind speed. Tracked Lift Force, Drag Force, $C_L$ and $ C_D$ Designed Wind Tunnel correlation CFD simulations for correspondence between simulation data and acquired data.</description>
